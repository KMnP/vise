**VisE** is a pretraining approach which leverages **Vis**ual **E**ngagement clues as supervisory signals. Given the same image, visual engagement provide semantically and contextually richer information than conventional recognition and captioning tasks.  VisE transfers well to subjective downstream computer vision tasks like emotion recognition or political bias classification.



## ðŸ’¬ Loading models with torch.hub

Get the pretrained ResNet-50 models from VisE *in one line*!  

:exclamation:**NOTE**: This is a torchvision-like model (all the layers before the last global average-pooling layer.). Given a batch of image tensors with size ``(B, 3, 224, 224)``, the provided models produce spatial image features of shape ``(B, 2048, 7, 7)``, where ``B``  is the batch size.

### VisE-250M (ResNet-50)

This model is pretrained with 250 million public image posts.

```python
import torch
model = torch.hub.load("KMnP/vise", "resnet50_250m", pretrained=True)
```

### VisE-1.2M (ResNet-50)

This model is pretrained with 1.23 million public image posts.

```python
import torch
model = torch.hub.load("KMnP/vise", "resnet50_1m", pretrained=True)
```
